Headphones Web Page Implementation Project

📄 Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented a fully functional web page from scratch, using only HTML, CSS, and the principles of Accessibility and Responsive Design. No external libraries or frameworks were used. This is a pure, handcrafted implementation that closely follows the provided designer file.

The primary objective was to demonstrate a solid understanding of:

Semantic HTML structure

CSS styling and layout techniques

Mobile-first responsive design

Accessibility best practices

Clean, maintainable, and scalable code

<!-- 🚀 Live Demo

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

Responsive Design (Media Queries, Flexbox)

Accessibility (ARIA roles, semantic elements, color contrast, keyboard navigation)


📐 Features

Fully responsive design: optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Clean and semantic HTML structure.

Accessible design with proper ARIA attributes and focus management.

Consistent design matching the provided designer file.

No external libraries, frameworks, or build tools.


🔧 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/csamii/alx_html_css.git

📱 Responsive Design

The layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes:

Desktop: > 1024px

Tablet: 768px - 1024px

Mobile: < 768px

I used a mobile-first approach for better performance and maintainability.


♿ Accessibility Features

Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer, etc.)

Meaningful alt text for images

Proper color contrast for readability

Logical tab order and keyboard navigation

ARIA roles where appropriate


💡 Challenges Faced

Translating the visual design into a fully responsive structure.

Ensuring consistent layout across multiple screen sizes.

Balancing accessibility with visual design constraints.

Avoiding any third-party libraries and writing all logic from scratch.


📌 Lessons Learned

Deepened my understanding of CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid).

Practiced structuring semantic HTML for accessibility.

Gained more experience with responsive design techniques.

Improved my attention to detail to match design specifications precisely.
