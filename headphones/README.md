Web Page Implementation Project

📄 Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented a fully functional web page from scratch, using only HTML, CSS, and the principles of Accessibility and Responsive Design. No external libraries or frameworks were used — this is a pure, handcrafted implementation that closely follows the provided designer file.

The primary objective was to demonstrate a solid understanding of:

Semantic HTML structure

CSS styling and layout techniques

Mobile-first responsive design

Accessibility best practices (a11y)

Clean, maintainable, and scalable code

🚀 Live Demo
(Optional: add a link here if you deploy it)

🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3

Responsive Design (Media Queries, Flexbox, Grid)

Accessibility (ARIA roles, semantic elements, color contrast, keyboard navigation)

📐 Features
Fully responsive design: optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Clean and semantic HTML structure.

Accessible design with proper ARIA attributes and focus management.

Consistent design matching the provided designer file.

No external libraries, frameworks, or build tools.

🔧 Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd your-repo-name
Open the index.html file in your browser directly:

You can simply double-click the file or use Live Server if using VS Code.

📱 Responsive Design
The layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes:

Desktop: > 1024px

Tablet: 768px - 1024px

Mobile: < 768px

I used a mobile-first approach for better performance and maintainability.

♿ Accessibility Features
Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer, etc.)

Meaningful alt text for images

Proper color contrast for readability

Logical tab order and keyboard navigation

ARIA roles where appropriate

💡 Challenges Faced
Translating the visual design into a fully responsive structure.

Ensuring consistent layout across multiple screen sizes.

Balancing accessibility with visual design constraints.

Avoiding any third-party libraries and writing all logic from scratch.

📌 Lessons Learned
Deepened my understanding of CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid).

Practiced structuring semantic HTML for accessibility.

Gained more experience with responsive design techniques.

Improved my attention to detail to match design specifications precisely.
